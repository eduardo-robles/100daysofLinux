* Hi! I'm Eduardo and this is my #100DaysofLinux Challenge

** Who am I?
I'm [[https://eduardorobles.com][Eduardo Robles]] and I'm looking for a job in the Open Source world. I've been
using Linux for 12+ years despite not having a computer science degree. I like
to say that I will always be a beginner despite using Linux for 10+ years.

I also started an instagram account called [[https://instagram.com/tacosandlinux][@tacosandlinux]] where I show off my
passion for Linux and Open Source. I also started a Linux User Group in my area,
check out [[https://stxlug.com][South Texas Linux User Group]] for info on that. So I'm just geek
looking to promote my passion for Open Source with the world.
